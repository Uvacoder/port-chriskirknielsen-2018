Let's dig a bit more, shall we?\nHe makes electronica music as Chronoise.\nHe loves synthwave and anything inspired by the '80s.\nHe likes watching classic movies and television shows.\nWhen he has time, he enjoys playing video games in order to relax and venture into new worlds.\nIf you're curious about what music he likes, he listens to a lot of rock and electronica.\nHe fancies reading riveting books with a cup of tea.\nFor over a decade, he has been using tools such as Photoshop and After Effects as well as languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.\nHe has always been self-sufficient, but also a team player and a MacGyver-worthy problem solver (minus the hair).\nHe lives in New York, but he was born in Lyon, France.\nIn addition to English, he also speaks French and Danish and you can throw Italian his way, as well!\n(however, he has a strong aversion for addressing himself in the third person…)"
